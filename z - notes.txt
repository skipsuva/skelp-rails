to set up scaffolds - model, db migration, controller, views:

  rails g scaffold MODEL attribute:string

  rails g scaffold Bar name:string address:string theme:string img_url:string
  rails g scaffold Patron name:string email:string age:integer
  rails g scaffold Review rating:integer comment:string would_recommend:boolean patron_id:integer bar_id:integer


need to integrate the foreign keys - Bar.first.reviews doesnt work...
  it  will replace the 'ids' in the review join table

  relationships might be okay...just need to have it recognize the belongs_to aspect of the review

  t.integer :id_ref, index: true, foreign_key: true
  ^ might be sufficient
